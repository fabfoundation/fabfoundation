#  Caterpillar Foundation Collaborates with Fab Foundation to Bring Advanced Digital Fabrication Technology and Training to Decatur Public Schools

**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**


**October 7, 2025 - Decatur, IL —** 

United by a shared vision of collaborative innovation and education, the Caterpillar Foundation and the Fab Foundation are working together to expand access to digital fabrication technology and equip students with the necessary skills to excel in STEM careers. Since 2022, the Caterpillar Foundation has provided more than $1.3 million to support STEM education initiatives led by the Fab Foundation in communities across the United States and internationally. Aiming to advance Industry 4.0-aligned skills, the latest step forward in this collaborative effort puts an exciting new innovation directly into the hands of teachers and students in Decatur, IL, with the help of the Decatur Public Schools Foundation (DPSF).

From September 29 to October 1, educators from MacArthur and Eisenhower High Schools gathered at Thinkwell Makerspace for an intensive training session focused on teaching with **Fab-in-a-Box**. An all-in-one, mobile solution for digital fabrication education, the Fab Foundation’s latest creation brings a hands-on, project-based approach to STEM learning in the classroom. Featuring a laser cutter, 3D printer, vinyl cutter, electronics kits, materials, and an integrated computer with design software, each Fab-in-a-Box unit has the core capabilities of a professional-grade digital fabrication workshop. And with the inclusion of custom curricular activities authored by the Fab Foundation, educators have at their fingertips everything needed to set their students on the path to proficiency in advanced manufacturing.

“With the introduction of Fab-in-a-Box, students will learn critical skills to help prepare them for STEM careers, and educators can feel more empowered and confident in teaching STEM curricula,” explained Sherry Lassiter, president and chief executive officer of the Fab Foundation. “The goal for this initiative is to open new doors to opportunity, both personal and professional. By joining the Fab Lab community, these educators and students become part of a powerful, worldwide network of makers sharing ideas, collaborating across disciplines, and learning together.”

On October 2, after three full days of professional development facilitated by the Fab Foundation’s education outreach team—which included assembling the units, learning to use each machine, and co-developing interactive lessons to incorporate this technology into classroom instruction—participating educators had the opportunity to unveil Fab-in-a-Box to a lucky group of their students during a community event held at Eisenhower High School. There, students were able to see and put their hands on the equipment for the first time. In a live demonstration, they used the computer and laser cutter to create custom gliders from balsa wood and then showcased the outcomes of their design decisions with live test flights before the gathered audience. In addition to familiarizing themselves with some of the technology featured in the Fab-in-a-Box kits, students learned about the four forces of flight and some key aspects of the engineering design process.

Three Fab-in-a-Box units have been provided to the two high schools and will be integrated into their curricula throughout the school year. Managed locally by DPSF, this program is expected to dramatically increase engagement in STEM programming and expose young people in Decatur to numerous real-world applications of the theories underpinning this learning, enabling them to make almost anything that they can imagine.

“Both school district leadership and our teaching cohort are thrilled to incorporate Fab-in-a-Box within our curriculum,” said Zach Shields, executive director of the Decatur Public Schools Foundation. “Encouraging STEM-focused career exploration is of paramount importance to us. Engaging students through creative classroom and extracurricular experiences represents the core mission for our organization, a mission the Caterpillar Foundation has supported significantly over the past decade-plus. This collaborative Fab Foundation venture signifies another meaningful step to spark student interest in STEM-related jobs available to them in the future. We are extremely thankful to participate.”

“At the Caterpillar Foundation, we believe that investing in innovative solutions like the Fab-in-a-Box is investing in the future of our communities," said Asha Varghese, president of the Caterpillar Foundation. “Over the past three years, the Foundation’s collaboration with the Fab Foundation has empowered hundreds of students across the country with hands-on STEM experiences. We’re proud to continue this momentum in Decatur—building on the Foundation’s historical collaboration with the Decatur Public Schools Foundation.” 

As a combined force, the Caterpillar Foundation, Fab Foundation, and DPSF are working to build a stronger, more resilient, and sustainable community in Decatur. By expanding access to advanced technology and hands-on STEM learning, such programs offer students a real opportunity to get an early start on acquiring the skills needed to participate fully in the modern workforce and, thereby, thrive well into the future.
