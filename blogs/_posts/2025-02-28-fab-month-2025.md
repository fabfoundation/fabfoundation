After a wildly successful inaugural run last year, **Fab Month** returns for its second edition to share the journey, impact, and innovations of the global Fab Lab movement. This free, online event—held throughout the month of April—offers a platform for knowledge exchange to promote collaboration and drive the continued advancement of the international Fab Lab Network.

Fab Month 2025 will be an open forum, where anyone, anywhere can share their experiences and insights. As we prepare to celebrate 25 years of the Fab Lab movement, this is a great opportunity for all members of our global community to come together and discuss how they’re exploring cutting-edge technologies to tackle local challenges or scale global impact within their unique contexts.
